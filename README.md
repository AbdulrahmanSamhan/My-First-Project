In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data for a company in the **fitness and supplements industry**. The goal was to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance and deliver key insights through **KPIs** that enhance strategic decision-making. The analysis covered various aspects, including revenue, profitability, return analysis, and more.

### Key Achievements:

- **Data Extraction**: Data was sourced directly from **SQL Server** using custom queries, allowing me to work with accurate, up-to-date data from multiple sources.

- **Data Cleaning**: I used **Power Query** to clean and transform raw data, preparing it for analysis by merging tables and ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

- **Data Modeling**: Implemented a star schema data model to optimize performance and simplify relationships between fact tables (e.g., sales) and dimension tables (e.g., customers, products). This model improved data relationships and facilitated efficient analysis.

- **Custom DAX Calculations**: Developed custom **DAX** measures to calculate important KPIs such as revenue, gross profit, customer counts, order quantities, and more. These measures enabled deeper insights into financial performance and trends.

### Key Areas of Analysis:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzed customer behavior, including purchase frequency, average order value (AOV), and retention vs. churn rates. This was crucial for understanding how customers interact with various products.

2. **Product Analysis**: Assessed product performance to identify top-selling products, areas for improvement, and the products with the highest profit margins.

3. **Location Insights**: Explored sales patterns by geographic location (city, region, country) to determine the best-performing areas and identify potential new markets.

4. **Time Analysis**: Tracked sales performance over time to analyze seasonality and predict future trends. This included comparing sales between months and analyzing year-to-date (YTD) revenue growth compared to the previous year.

5. **Return Analysis**: Focused on return data to understand which products or regions had higher return rates. This analysis aimed to improve product strategies and reduce future losses.

### Dashboard Design:
- Created an interactive dashboard that allows managers and stakeholders to easily track KPIs. The dashboard includes clear and interactive visuals displaying revenue performance, profitability, sales trends, and more.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Added dynamic filters to enable users to drill down into data by time periods, locations, or product categories, enhancing the overall data analysis experience.

### Final Results:
- This analysis provided the company with a comprehensive and accurate view of its current performance, highlighting areas for improvement.
- Key insights included identifying the most profitable products, top-engaged customers, and best-performing geographic areas, empowering the company to make more informed, data-driven decisions.
